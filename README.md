This is my first project. if you have any suggestions, please message me by discord! (Jack74593#5485)

How to use:

Download the file from the Release tab.
Run it.
Wait for a while (for the first tiem running), and when the window appears, you're done! Use it like the normal notepad. There's also an event tab which shows if a file failed/successfully loaded!

Other info:

If the freaking windows defender stupid screen says its a virus, dont mind that, just run it. The code is in the TextEdit.py file and you can check it by yourself. Idk why but maybe windows defender dont like pyinstaller or something.
